# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started a course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning course by Deeplearning.ai (Coursera)

**Thoughts:** Completed week 1 out of 4, learned about the basic introduction of a standard neural network, its types (CNN,RNN,hybrid), how and when they will be used in an suprervised learning approach. New word : RELU function (Partial intro given).
