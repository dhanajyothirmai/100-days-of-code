# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started a course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning course by Deeplearning.ai (Coursera)

**Thoughts:** Completed week 1 out of 4, learned about the basic introduction of a standard neural network, its types (CNN,RNN,hybrid), how and when they will be used in an suprervised learning approach. New word : RELU function (Partial intro given).

              1. Perceptrons
              2. Error Functions
              3. Discrete and Continuous functions
              4. Softmax function
              5. Onehot encoding technique.
              6. Maximum Probabilities and minimum error function interesting connection.

### Day 1: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
